- RESTful APIs

    - Representational State Transfer
    - Roy Fielding, 2000
    - Not a standard or protocol, more of an architectural style
    - Very scalable



- Principles of REST

    1. Client-Server
         The client and server communicate through the interface and are independent of
           each other.

    2. Stateless
         Every request is independent and complete.  There is no dependence on previous
           requests or a session state.

    3. Cacheable
         Things can be cached on the server-side or client-side to improve performance.

    4. Layered System
         There can be multiple layers which perform different functions, such as caching
           and encryption.

    5. Uniform Interface
         The interface always stays the same, which helps with decoupling the server and
           client.



- HTTP 

    - Methods

        GET       Read data
        POST      Create data
        PUT       Update data completely
        PATCH     Update data partially
        DELETE    Delete data


    - Commonly Used Status Codes

        200 OK             means the request has been successful. Could be a GET, PUT, or PATCH.
        201 Created        means the POST request has been successful and a record has been created.
        204 No Content     means the DELETE request has been successful.

        400 Bad Request    means there is something wrong with the client request.
        401 Unauthorized   means the client request is missing authentication details.
        403 Forbidden      means the requested resource is forbidden.
        404 Not Found      means the requested resource doesn't exist.



- JSON

    Syntax Basics:
      - Arrays are enclosed by []
      - Objects are represented by {}
      - Names/values always exist in pairs and are delimited by :
      - Strings are enclosed by ""


    {  
      "recipes":[    
        {      
          "id":1,
          "name":"Egg Salad",
          "description":"Place an egg in a saucepan and..."
        },    
        {      
          "id":2,
          "name":"Tomato Pasta",
          "description":"Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil..."
        }
      ]
    }



- Sample App - Simplest Possible App

    - Create a requirements.txt file:

        requirements.txt
        ---------------------------
        Flask==1.0.3
        httpie==1.0.2

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt


    - Now create a simple app in app.py:

        app.py
        ---------------------------
        from flask import Flask

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route("/")
        def hello():
            return "Hello World!"

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run()


    - And run it:

        $ python app.py



- Sample App - Recipe Book

    - Recipe Model

        Id            = Unique id
        Name          = Recipe Name
        Description   =  Recipe Description


    - We add our view methods to GET, POST, and PUT recipes in 'recipes.py'.


    - To get all of the recipes:

        # httpie
        http GET localhost:5000/recipes

        # curl
        curl -i -X GET localhost:5000/recipes


    - To get a single recipe:

        # httpie
        http GET localhost:5000/recipes/1

        # curl
        curl -i -X GET localhost:5000/recipes/1 


    - To create a new recipe:

        # httpie
        http POST localhost:5000/recipes name="Cheese Pizza" 
            description="This is a lovely cheese pizza"

        # curl
        curl -i -X POST localhost:5000/recipes -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
            -d '{"name":"Cheese Pizza", "description":"This is a lovely cheese pizza"}'


    - To update an existing recipe:

        # httpie
        http PUT localhost:5000/recipes/3 name="Lovely Cheese Pizza" 
            description="This is a lovely cheese pizza recipe."

        # curl
        curl -i -X PUT localhost:5000/recipes/3 -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
            -d '{"name":"Lovely Cheese Pizza", "description":"This is a lovely cheese pizza recipe."}'


    - To delete a recipe:

        # httpie
        http DELETE localhost:5000/recipes/1

        # curl
        curl -i -X DELETE localhost:5000/recipes/1
